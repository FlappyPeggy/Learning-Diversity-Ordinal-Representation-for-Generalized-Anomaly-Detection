# Learning-Diversity-Ordinal-Representation-for-Generalized-Anomaly-Detection
This is official code for paper “Learning Diversity-Ordinal Representation for Generalized Anomaly Detection”, also a rethink of the diversity-measurable representation.
Privious version of the paper is available at [DMSSD](https://openreview.net/forum?id=1IIiQnLRe8) (an **imporvement** of DMAD for **OoD detection**!)

The complete code will be provided after the paper is received.
